Project Title: Task Management API using Express.js
Objective:
To build a RESTful API that allows users to manage tasks with CRUD functionality,
 stored in memory without any database.

Approach:

Express.js used for fast and minimalist web server setup.

Router and controller separation to keep logic modular.

Tasks stored in a global array with an auto-incrementing ID.

Validation is handled using a helper function.

Pagination, sorting, and filtering are implemented for better querying.

Algorithm Choices:

Linear search (find, findIndex) is used for small in-memory arrays.

Pagination uses slice(start, end) after calculating offset.

Error Handling:

Status codes: 200, 201, 400, 404, 500

Basic global error middleware for unhandled errors.

Testing Tools:

Postman used for manual testing of all endpoints.

Example curl commands provided in README.
